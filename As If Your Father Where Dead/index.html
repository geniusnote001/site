<h2 id="as-if-your-father-where-dead">As If Your Father Where Dead</h2>
<p>In a small town nestled among rolling hills, there lived a man named Mateo. Mateo had always been a dutiful son, striving to meet his father's expectations and seeking his approval in every aspect of his life. His father, Harold, was a stern and demanding man, with a critical eye that seemed to cast a shadow over Mateo's every endeavor.</p>
<p>One fateful day, the news of Harold's passing reached Mateo's ears. Emotions welled up inside him, a mix of sadness, nostalgia, and something unexpected. Relief. Despite the weight of grief, Mateo couldn't deny a subtle sense of liberation. With his father's departure, the burden of living up to his expectations and enduring his constant criticisms had been lifted.</p>
<p>As days turned into weeks, Mateo found himself pondering the impact his father had on his life. He wondered how different things might have been if he had never felt the need to please his father or prove his worthiness. The weight of those expectations had limited him in countless ways, stifling his true desires and passions.</p>
<p>Determined to break free from the lingering influence of his father, Mateo decided to embark on a transformative journey. For the next three days, he would engage in activities he had long avoided or suppressed, solely because of his father's judgment.</p>
<p>On the first day, Mateo recalled his childhood love for painting, an art form he had given up pursuing due to his father's dismissive remarks about the impracticality of such a pursuit. He dusted off his old paintbrushes, set up a canvas in his attic, and began to create. As he dipped the brush into vibrant hues and let his creativity flow, Mateo felt a sense of liberation, as if he were reclaiming a piece of his soul that had been stifled for far too long.</p>
<p>The following day, Mateo headed to a nearby theater, a place he had avoided since his father had always regarded acting as a frivolous pursuit. With trepidation and excitement, he auditioned for a local play. Though nervous, he delivered a heartfelt monologue, channeling the emotions that had built up over years of repressed self-expression. Surprisingly, he landed a supporting role, and the applause that followed echoed in his ears like a chorus of newfound freedom.</p>
<p>On the final day of his self-imposed challenge, Mateo took a leap into the world of entrepreneurship. His father had always scoffed at the idea of starting a business, insisting on a stable corporate career. Yet, Mateo had a burning desire to forge his own path. He drafted a business plan, registered his company, and took the first steps toward turning his long-held dreams into a reality. The weight of his father's expectations gradually lifted as he embraced the thrill of pursuing his own vision.</p>
<p>Throughout those three transformative days, Mateo's spirit grew stronger. He learned to detach himself from his father's judgments, recognizing that they were a part of his past, not his present or future. The freedom he sought wasn't just about external liberation but also about liberating himself from the shackles of self-judgment.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, Mateo's life took on a new hue. He pursued painting with passion, took part in community theater productions, and nurtured his growing business. He encountered setbacks and moments of doubt, but the memory of those three days of liberation reminded him of the path he had chosen and the freedom he had claimed for himself.</p>
<p>Mateo became a symbol of resilience and self-discovery, inspiring others to embrace their true selves and break free from the expectations imposed by society and loved ones. He knew that to be a free man, one must love and honor their roots, yet find the courage to chart their own course, unburdened by the weight of external expectations</p></div>
