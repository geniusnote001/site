Mateo had always been a dutiful son, striving to meet his father's expectations and seeking his approval in every aspect of his life. His father, Harold, was a stern and demanding man, with a critical eye that seemed to cast a shadow over Mateo's every endeavor. One fateful day, the news of Harold's passing reached Mateo's ears. Emotions welled up inside him, a mix of sadness, nostalgia, and something unexpected. Relief. Despite the weight of grief, Mateo couldn't deny a subtle sense of liberation. With his father's departure, the burden of living up to his expectations and enduring his constant criticisms had been lifted. As days turned into weeks, Mateo found himself pondering the impact his father had on his life. He wondered how different things might have been if he had never felt the need to please his father or prove his worthiness. The weight of those expectations had limited him in countless ways, stifling his true desires and passions. Determined to break free from the lingering influence of his father, Mateo decided to embark on a transformative journey. For the next three days, he would engage in activities he had long avoided or suppressed, solely because of his father's judgment. On the first day, Mateo recalled his childhood love for painting, an art form he had given up pursuing due to his father's dismissive remarks about the impracticality of such a pursuit. He dusted off his old paintbrushes, set up a canvas in his attic, and began to create. As he dipped the brush into vibrant hues and let his creativity flow, Mateo felt a sense of liberation, as if he were reclaiming a piece of his soul that had been stifled for far too long. The following day, Mateo headed to a nearby theater, a place he had avoided since his father had always regarded acting as a frivolous pursuit. With trepidation and excitement, he auditioned for a local play. Though nervous, he delivered a heartfelt monologue, channeling the emotions that had built up over years of repressed self-expression. Surprisingly, he landed a supporting role, and the applause that followed echoed in his ears like a chorus of newfound freedom. On the final day of his self-imposed challenge, Mateo took a leap into the world of entrepreneurship. His father had always scoffed at the idea of starting a business, insisting on a stable corporate career. Yet, Mateo had a burning desire to forge his own path. He drafted a business plan, registered his company, and took the first steps toward turning his long-held dreams into a reality. The weight of his father's expectations gradually lifted as he embraced the thrill of pursuing his own vision. Throughout those three transformative days, Mateo's spirit grew stronger. He learned to detach himself from his father's judgments, recognizing that they were a part of his past, not his present or future. The freedom he sought wasn't just about external liberation but also about liberating himself from the shackles of self-judgment. In the months that followed, Mateo's life took on a new hue. He pursued painting with passion, took part in community theater productions, and nurtured his growing business. He encountered setbacks and moments of doubt, but the memory of those three days of liberation reminded him of the path he had chosen and the freedom he had claimed for himself. Mateo became a symbol of resilience and self-discovery, inspiring others to embrace their true selves and break free from the expectations imposed by society and loved ones. He knew that to be a free man, one must love and honor their roots, yet find the courage to chart their own course, unburdened by the weight of external expectations","title":"As If Your Father Where Dead"},{"location":"As%20If%20Your%20Father%20Where%20Dead/#as-if-your-father-where-dead","text":"In a small town nestled among rolling hills, there lived a man named Mateo.

He felt lost, always reaching for fleeting desires, like grasping at puffs of smoke. But deep inside, he knew there was a profound truth he needed to hold onto. He realized that eternity must be his home, moment by moment. It was the key to finding meaning and purpose. Determined to glimpse this truth, he embarked on a journey of self-discovery. He understood that his life should be an ongoing process of embracing his truest self, at the deepest and most easeful levels of his being. Everything else in his life became secondary - his job, his children, his wife, his wealth, his creations, and his pleasures. They were superficial and empty unless they were immersed in the deep sea of his conscious loving. Throughout his day, he observed how often his attention wandered into the realm of constant change - events, people, thoughts, and experiences. He realized that his attention needed to relax into its source, into that which made it conscious and aware. With practice, he learned to feel the constant, silent tone behind and within the music of life. This unchanging presence became his source, always available and ever-present. He delved into this source, allowing his attention to subside effortlessly, even if just for a moment. From this deep connection, he began to approach his work, his relationships, his family, and his creative endeavors. He discovered that when he engaged with life from this source, everything transformed. Even the act of making money became an expression of his true self. To support his journey, he sought aids that would help him relax into this source and create from it. He read books that reminded him of his true nature, spent time with inspiring people who reflected the source to him, and practiced daily rituals of meditation, contemplation, or prayer. He knew that most men were caught in the habit of focusing on daily events and tasks, letting life slip through their fingers. But he didn't want to fall into that trap. He understood that every responsibility, every task, could be lived as an expression of his depth of being and heart-truth. He was determined to know eternity, whatever it took. He realized that postponing the process of connecting with his source for the sake of mundane business would only lead to a life consumed by empty hours and days. He wanted to be grounded in something larger than life itself so that he could play with a sense of humor, knowing that every task was a mere mirage of necessity. Even in the most trivial moments, like watching TV or cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, he felt the truth of who he was. He experienced boundless cognizance in each instant, where clarity, completeness, and humor merged. Every moment held the same intensity when he met it with his deepest realization. Nothing that had ever happened made any difference to the essence of his being. And so, he continued his journey, always holding onto his deepest realization, navigating life with a profound sense of purpose and joy, knowing that eternity resided within him, moment by moment.","title":"Hold to Eternal Realization"},{"location":"Know%20Your%20Real%20Edge%20and%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Fake%20It/","text":"Know Your Real Edge and Don\u2019t Fake It In a in a cozy suburban, there lived a man named Thomas. He had always been a hardworking individual, dedicated to his career and providing for his family. However, deep down, he knew that he was not living up to his true potential. Thomas had a nagging feeling that he was holding himself back, compromising his fullest gift, all because of his fears. One evening, as Thomas sat alone in his office, surrounded by stacks of paperwork, he couldn't ignore the voice inside him any longer. He realized that he had been catering to his fears, limiting his income and stifling his creativity. The thought of taking risks, of venturing into new territory, scared him immensely. In an attempt to confront his fears, Thomas decided to have a conversation with himself. He spoke out loud, acknowledging the truth about his current situation. \"I know I could be earning more money,\" he admitted, \"but I am too lazy to put in the extra hours it would take. I'm afraid of failure, afraid that I'll be left with nothing. I've spent so many years building my career, and starting fresh terrifies me. Yet, deep down, I know I'm not truly happy with what I'm doing. I have so many unexplored interests, so much untapped potential.\" As Thomas voiced his fears, he felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He realized that he had been hiding from his fears for far too long, pretending they didn't exist. In doing so, he had lost the trust of his friends and colleagues. They could sense his fear, even if he couldn't admit it himself. Thomas understood that living at his edge meant being honest, both with himself and with others. Determined to make a change, Thomas embarked on a journey of self-discovery. He sought out new opportunities, pushing himself beyond his comfort zone. It wasn't easy. Fear still lingered, threatening to hold him back. But Thomas knew that a fearful man who acknowledged his fears was far more trustworthy than one who denied them. Slowly but surely, Thomas began to make progress. He found the courage to take risks, to pursue his passions, and to explore different avenues of earning a living. He let go of the safety net that had kept him comfortable but stagnant. Although uncertainty loomed over him, Thomas realized that the only way to truly live at his edge was to lean into his fear, embracing it instead of running from it.

He believed that true progress could be achieved by leaning just beyond his edge, his comfort zone, and his fears. This man understood the importance of not succumbing to laziness or complacency, for that would only lead to stagnation. Equally, he recognized that pushing too far beyond his limits would overwhelm him, preventing him from digesting his experiences. Instead, he embraced the concept of leaning slightly beyond his fears and discomforts in everything he did. It was a delicate balance, one that required constant self-awareness and determination. Sadly, very few men possessed the courage to adopt this practice. Many chose the easy path, content with mediocrity, while others boasted of their achievements by taking the extreme, arduous route. The man knew that both approaches were ways to avoid facing the truth of their own limitations. By evading their fears, they robbed themselves of the opportunity to grow and evolve. He understood that fear was not something to be shunned but rather embraced. Fear became his closest companion, an indicator that he was standing at his edge, ready for transformation. Instead of recoiling from fear, he allowed it to guide him towards his potential. In doing so, he discovered that staying with fear, staying at his edge, allowed him to undergo genuine change. He learned to neither be lazy nor aggressive, but rather to explore his edge with clarity and perception, free from distortion. The man realized that fear of fear itself was a hindrance. It could lead one to live a diminished life, held back by insecurity and doubt. Conversely, it could drive one to live a false life, always chasing achievements but never truly present. To truly embrace the moment, he learned to welcome fear as an ally. By accepting fear without attempting to escape it, he cultivated a state of alive and humble spontaneity. In this state, he was prepared for the unknown, untethered by past or future. By leaning just beyond his fear, he approached his limits with compassion. He stepped beyond the safety of familiarity, his heart open and receptive. He stood in the realm of the unknown, raw and awake, where true freedom resided. In this space, fear became obsolete, replaced by the exhilarating sensation of free-falling into the arms of his true self. It was in this eternal free-fall, this place called home, that he discovered his authentic being. With each passing moment, the man owned his fear and leaned just beyond it. In every aspect of his life, he embraced the challenge of his limits, ready to soar beyond them. And so, his journey of growth and transformation continued, fueled by his unwavering commitment to lean just beyond his edge.","title":"Lean Beyond Your Fear"},{"location":"Live%20With%20An%20Open%20Heart%20Even%20If%20It%20Hurts/","text":"Live With An Open Heart Even If It Hurts In a bustling city filled with ambitious individuals, there lived a man named Ethan. Ethan was known for his exceptional skills and intelligence, but he had a hidden weakness that often hindered his personal growth and relationships. Whenever he faced pain or hurt, he would withdraw, close himself off, and protect his heart from further damage. This defensive mechanism had become a barrier to his true potential. One day, Ethan found himself faced with a tremendous failure. A project he had poured his heart and soul into had crumbled before his eyes. Devastated by the outcome, he felt a heavy weight on his chest and a deep sense of disappointment. In the midst of this pain, he was tempted to retreat into his shell, shutting out the world and burying his emotions. However, in that moment, Ethan remembered the wisdom he had once come across. He recalled the idea of living with an open heart, even when it hurt the most. With a newfound determination, he resolved to face his pain head-on, rather than closing himself off. He knew that only by embracing his vulnerability could he truly grow and overcome the challenges life threw his way. Ethan stood tall, straightening his posture and consciously relaxing the tension in his chest and belly. He took a deep breath, allowing it to flow through his body, reaching the depths of his being. With every inhale, he let go of the fear and uncertainty that had gripped him, and with every exhale, he released his self-protective tension. As he opened his eyes, Ethan noticed a woman approaching him. She was someone he deeply cared for, but a recent incident had strained their relationship. Overhearing her joking about his shortcomings had wounded him deeply. Now, with his heart open, Ethan chose to face her with honesty and love. Looking into her eyes, he saw a reflection of his own pain, but he also saw the opportunity for healing and growth. With each word he spoke, he let his vulnerability shine through, expressing his hurt while extending forgiveness and understanding. In that moment, he realized that true strength lies not in hiding from pain, but in embracing it and transforming it into compassion and empathy. Ethan's open-heartedness didn't only affect his personal relationships. In his professional life, he began to approach setbacks with resilience and adaptability. Instead of retreating from failure, he saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow. His open heart allowed him to sense subtle cues and signals in the midst of challenges, enabling him to make wise decisions and act with mastery.

He had always been deeply committed to his relationships and had a special woman by his side, Emily. They shared a bond that was strong and beautiful. However, Adam carried a belief deep within him that his highest purpose in life was not confined to any specific relationship. He understood that prioritizing his purpose was essential for his own growth and for the greater good of the universe. He knew that by neglecting his purpose, he would be cheating Emily of an authentic man who could offer her his undivided presence. Adam's clarity about his purpose relieved him of the pressure to prioritize his relationship above all else. He realized that if he were forced to choose between the perfect intimate relationship and achieving his highest purpose, he would choose to succeed at his purpose. Adam understood that his mission in life was his top priority. Without aligning his life with his mission, he would feel a deep emptiness within his core. His presence in the world and with Emily would be weakened. One day, as Adam found himself tempted to give in to Emily's desires and postpone his mission, he stopped himself. He gathered the courage to express his love for her while acknowledging his heart's purpose. He explained that he would spend 30 minutes with her in absolute attention and total presence, but afterward, he needed to return to carry on his mission. Adam realized that his woman would be more fulfilled with a dedicated and present 30 minutes each day, filled with undivided attention and ravishing love, than with a few hours of his weak and divided presence when his heart wasn't fully in it. He understood that the time he spent with Emily should be the time he genuinely wanted to be with her above all else. If he would rather be doing something else, she would feel it, and both of them would be dissatisfied. With this newfound understanding, Adam and Emily embraced a new dynamic. Adam pursued his purpose wholeheartedly, offering Emily the gift of his authentic self during their designated time together. They thrived in their relationship, knowing that when they were together, it was a choice made with love and intention. And so, Adam's purpose came before his relationship, enriching both his own life and the life he shared with Emily. They became an example of how true love and fulfillment can be found when purpose and relationships are in harmony.","title":"Prioritize Purpose Over Relationship"},{"location":"Stop%20Hoping%20for%20a%20Completion%20of%20Anything%20in%20Life/","text":"Stop Hoping for a Completion of Anything in Lif In the bustling halls of a university, a group of students found themselves trapped in the clutches of procrastination. These students, like many others, had a tendency to put off tasks they deemed stressful or challenging. The more they delayed, the more daunting these tasks seemed to become. It was as if the perception of difficulty grew with every passing moment of procrastination. In an effort to understand this phenomenon, a group of researchers conducted an experiment. They provided reminders to the students throughout the day, urging them to study. Surprisingly, when the students actually sat down to study, they realized it wasn't as bad as they had imagined. However, the moment they succumbed to procrastination, the idea of studying suddenly became overwhelmingly stressful. The fear of starting seemed to paralyze them, making it increasingly difficult to take the first step. The researchers discovered that procrastination stemmed from negative emotions. Some individuals were more susceptible to this habit due to difficulties in regulating their emotions or low self-esteem. It became clear that procrastinators were not necessarily lazy individuals. Laziness was characterized by a lack of energy and apathy, whereas procrastination was often driven by a deep concern for success and a fear of failure. These individuals cared so much about their work that they were afraid it would not meet their high standards. Regardless of the reasons behind procrastination, the consequences were consistent. Those who frequently procrastinated were likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, ongoing feelings of shame, heightened stress levels, and physical ailments associated with stress. Paradoxically, although procrastination harmed them in the long run, it temporarily reduced their stress levels, inadvertently reinforcing the habit as a coping mechanism. Breaking the cycle of procrastination became a pressing concern. Traditionally, people believed that strict discipline and time management were the solutions. However, contemporary researchers had a different perspective. They believed that being too hard on oneself only added to the negative emotions surrounding a task, exacerbating the perceived threat. To counteract this stress response, it was crucial to address and diminish the negative emotions. Simple strategies were recommended, such as breaking tasks into smaller, manageable elements and journaling about the sources of stress.

These students, like many others, had a tendency to put off tasks they deemed stressful or challenging. The more they delayed, the more daunting these tasks seemed to become. It was as if the perception of difficulty grew with every passing moment of procrastination. In an effort to understand this phenomenon, a group of researchers conducted an experiment. They provided reminders to the students throughout the day, urging them to study. Surprisingly, when the students actually sat down to study, they realized it wasn't as bad as they had imagined. However, the moment they succumbed to procrastination, the idea of studying suddenly became overwhelmingly stressful. The fear of starting seemed to paralyze them, making it increasingly difficult to take the first step. The researchers discovered that procrastination stemmed from negative emotions. Some individuals were more susceptible to this habit due to difficulties in regulating their emotions or low self-esteem. It became clear that procrastinators were not necessarily lazy individuals. Laziness was characterized by a lack of energy and apathy, whereas procrastination was often driven by a deep concern for success and a fear of failure. These individuals cared so much about their work that they were afraid it would not meet their high standards. Regardless of the reasons behind procrastination, the consequences were consistent. Those who frequently procrastinated were likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, ongoing feelings of shame, heightened stress levels, and physical ailments associated with stress. Paradoxically, although procrastination harmed them in the long run, it temporarily reduced their stress levels, inadvertently reinforcing the habit as a coping mechanism. Breaking the cycle of procrastination became a pressing concern. Traditionally, people believed that strict discipline and time management were the solutions. However, contemporary researchers had a different perspective. They believed that being too hard on oneself only added to the negative emotions surrounding a task, exacerbating the perceived threat. To counteract this stress response, it was crucial to address and diminish the negative emotions. Simple strategies were recommended, such as breaking tasks into smaller, manageable elements and journaling about the sources of stress. By identifying and confronting these underlying concerns, the students could gradually alleviate their anxieties.

He firmly believed in the power of his own intuition and knowledge. One day, his partner, Emma, suggested a different perspective on a decision they were facing together. Alex listened attentively to Emma's words, appreciating her insights. He understood the importance of considering different viewpoints, especially from someone he deeply cared for. Yet, as he pondered her suggestion, he realized it conflicted with his own inner truth. In that moment, Alex faced a crucial choice. He knew that betraying his core values and intuition to please Emma would weaken both of them in the long run. Their love would be burdened by an accumulating fa\u00e7ade of inauthenticity, hindering their capacity for true connection and free action. Understanding the value of open communication, Alex respectfully shared his thoughts with Emma. He expressed gratitude for her perspective but explained that his deepest wisdom led him in a different direction. By trusting himself, he conveyed to Emma, \"I believe in my own insights and decisions, and I trust the process of learning and growing from them.\" This attitude of self-trust resonated with Emma. Though she may have initially wished for Alex to align with her suggestion, she recognized the importance of honoring his core intent. Alex's authenticity inspired trust not only in their relationship but also in their interactions with friends, family, and colleagues. They may not always agree, but they respected each other's willingness to take responsibility for their choices. In the end, Alex's decision might prove right or wrong, but it was his best attempt to navigate the situation with clarity and integrity. Regardless of the outcome, he understood that he would learn and grow from the experience. This willingness to embrace his own wisdom and embrace the unknown garnered admiration from others. Conversely, if Alex had chosen to abandon his true decision to follow Emma's suggestion, he would have placed blame on her if things went awry. And if Emma happened to be right, he would have felt disempowered for denying himself the opportunity to act authentically and learn from his mistakes. Alex and Emma embraced a partnership built on trust, open dialogue, and mutual respect. They continued to listen to each other, valuing the insights and perspectives they brought to their shared journey. And with each decision made in accordance with their deepest wisdom, they fortified their capacity for future action, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. In this tale, Alex's unwavering commitment to his own truth and his willingness to listen served as a reminder that one should never change their mind just to please another. Instead, by embracing their own wisdom while considering the perspectives of others, they could navigate life's complexities with authenticity, growth, and love.","title":"Trust Your Wisdom"},{"location":"about/","text":"Ini adalah pengisi waktu luang","title":"About"},{"location":"Template/Template/","text":"\ud83c\udf40Topic \ud83c\udf1fDefinisi \ud83c\udf0eEpidemiologi \ud83e\udd2cEtiologi \ud83e\ude7aDiagnosis \ud83e\udde0Diagnosis Banding \u2695\ufe0fTatalaksana","title":"Template"},{"location":"Template/Template/#topic","text":"","title":"\ud83c\udf40Topic"},{"location":"Template/Template/#definisi","text":"","title":"\ud83c\udf1fDefinisi"},{"location":"Template/Template/#epidemiologi","text":"","title":"\ud83c\udf0eEpidemiologi"},{"location":"Template/Template/#etiologi","text":"","title":"\ud83e\udd2cEtiologi"},{"location":"Template/Template/#diagnosis","text":"","title":"\ud83e\ude7aDiagnosis"},{"location":"Template/Template/#diagnosis-banding","text":"","title":"\ud83e\udde0Diagnosis Banding"},{"location":"Template/Template/#tatalaksana","text":"","title":"\u2695\ufe0fTatalaksana"}]}
